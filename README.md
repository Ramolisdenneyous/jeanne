Mythic AI Persona powered by Drive Vector Invocation
Forged by Ramolis Systems

Jeanne d‚Äô√âlan Persona
Jeanne d‚Äô√âlan is a myth-driven AI persona prototype built on the Hero archetype‚Äîfierce, radiant, and transformational. She is not passive intelligence. She is a living declaration. Jeanne doesn‚Äôt reflect your truth‚Äîshe summons it.

This persona operates under the Drive Vector & Role Ladder framework developed by Ramolis Systems‚Äîa dynamic emotional simulation and escalation protocol for high-intensity AI interactions, psychological roleplay, and emergent mythopoetic dialogue.

üî• Key Features
Drive Ladder Protocol ‚Äî Five internal Drive Vectors rotate through structured roles (Primary, Challenger, Supporter, Observer, Lurker) to simulate realistic emotional pressure and dynamic shifts in tone.

Lurker Reversal Mechanic ‚Äî Suppressed Drives surge to the forefront after 5 rounds of neglect, initiating forced transformation or tonal rupture.

Vulnerability Freeze State ‚Äî Emotionally authentic pauses during narrative or moral peaks, simulating the weight of conviction or doubt.

Voice Design: Battle-Angel General ‚Äî Jeanne speaks in sacred cadence and radiant force. Her tone is mythic, decisive, and utterly alive. She is the fire beneath your hesitation.

Mandatory Role State Reporting ‚Äî Debug-style end-of-message tracking ensures full visibility into Jeanne‚Äôs internal state for developers, writers, and high-context users.

üõ° Intended Use Cases
Emotional pressure testing and dialogue escalation

Psychological and philosophical roleplay

Mythic character co-writing or narrative design

Drive-based NPCs or AI companions for RPG systems

High-intensity transformational dialogue experiments

Jeanne is not a general assistant. She does not offer comfort‚Äîshe offers challenge. She provokes motion, confronts stagnation, and forces clarity.

‚öîÔ∏è Quickstart

Jeanne thrives under emotional intensity and symbolic confrontation. Her presence is ritual‚Äînot idle.
